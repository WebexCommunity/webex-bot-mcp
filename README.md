## Prerequisites

Before setting up this MCP server, you'll need to create a Webex bot and obtain its access token.

### Creating a Webex Bot

1. **Go to the Webex Developer Portal**:
   - Visit https://developer.webex.com
   - Sign in with your Webex account (create one if you don't have it)

2. **Create a New Bot**:
   - Click on "My Webex Apps" in the top navigation
   - Click "Create a New App"
   - Select "Create a Bot"

3. **Configure Your Bot**:
   - **Bot Name**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "Notification Bot", "Alert Bot")
   - **Bot Username**: This will be the bot's unique identifier (e.g., "notificationbot")
   - **Icon**: Upload an icon for your bot (optional but recommended)
   - **Description**: Describe what your bot does
   - Click "Add Bot"

4. **Get Your Bot Access Token**:
   - After creating the bot, you'll see the bot details page
   - **Important**: Copy the "Bot Access Token" immediately - this won't be shown again
   - The token starts with something like `Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VzL0FQUExJQ0FUSU9O...`
   - Store this token securely - you'll use it as your `WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`

5. **Bot Limitations to Know**:
   - Bots can only see messages in rooms where they are explicitly added
   - To send messages to a room, the bot must be a member of that room
   - Bots cannot see messages in 1:1 spaces unless the other person messages the bot first
   - Bots have rate limits (typically 10 messages per second)

### Adding Your Bot to Rooms

For your bot to send messages to rooms, it must be added as a member:

1. **For Group Rooms**:
   - Go to the Webex app
   - Open the room where you want the bot to send messages
   - Click the room name at the top
   - Click "People"
   - Click "Add People"
   - Search for your bot's username (e.g., "@notificationbot")
   - Add the bot to the room

2. **For Direct Messages**:
   - Users can start a 1:1 conversation with your bot by searching for its username
   - Or you can send direct messages using the user's email address

## Installing uv

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package management. You'll need to install uv first.

### Install uv

**macOS and Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**
```bash
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Alternative installation methods:**
- **Homebrew (macOS)**: `brew install uv`
- **pip**: `pip install uv`
- **pipx**: `pipx install uv`

### Find uv Path for Claude Desktop

For Claude Desktop configuration, you may need the full path to uv. You can find it using:

```bash
which uv
```

This will return something like:
- **macOS/Linux**: `/Users/username/.cargo/bin/uv` or `/usr/local/bin/uv`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\username\.cargo\bin\uv.exe`

If `which uv` doesn't work, try:
```bash
whereis uv
```

**Note**: If you installed uv via the official installer, it's typically located at:
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.cargo/bin/uv`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin\uv.exe`

You can use either the full path or just `uv` in your Claude Desktop configuration if uv is in your system PATH.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and add your Webex bot access token:
   ```
   WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_bot_access_token_here
   ```

3. **Test Your Bot Token**:
   You can verify your bot token works by testing it:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" \
        https://webexapis.com/v1/people/me
   ```
   This should return your bot's information.

- Use threaded replies to keep conversations organized
- Set up different bots for different types of notifications
- Test your bot in a dedicated testing room first

## Running the MCP Server

The server supports two transport types: stdio (default) and streamable-http.

### Stdio Transport (Default)

```bash
uv run main.py
```

### Streamable HTTP Transport

```bash
uv run main.py --transport streamable-http
```

You can also customize the host and port for HTTP transport:

```bash
uv run main.py --transport streamable-http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
```

### Command Line Options

- `--transport`: Choose transport type (`stdio` or `streamable-http`, default: `stdio`)
- `--host`: Host to bind to for streamable-http transport (default: `localhost`)
- `--port`: Port to bind to for streamable-http transport (default: `8000`)

Use `--help` to see all available options:

```bash
uv run main.py --help
```

## Claude Desktop Integration

To use this MCP server with Claude Desktop, you'll need to add the server configuration to your Claude Desktop config file.

### Configuration File Location

The Claude Desktop configuration file is located at:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### Standard Configuration (Stdio Transport)

Add this configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "webex-bot-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/your/webex-bot-mcp",
        "run",
        "main.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_webex_bot_access_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: If `uv` is not in your system PATH, replace `"uv"` with the full path to uv (e.g., `"/Users/username/.cargo/bin/uv"` on macOS/Linux or `"C:\\Users\\username\\.cargo\\bin\\uv.exe"` on Windows). See the [Installing uv](#installing-uv) section above for how to find the full path.

### Setup Steps

1. **Replace the placeholder**: Change `your_webex_bot_access_token_here` to your actual Webex bot access token
2. **Update the path**: Change `/path/to/your/webex-bot-mcp` to match your actual project directory location
3. **Copy the configuration**: Add the configuration to your Claude Desktop config file
4. **Restart Claude Desktop**: Close and reopen Claude Desktop to load the new configuration
5. **Test the MCP server**: You can now use the MCP server in Claude Desktop to interact with Webex rooms and send messages

## Sample Prompts for AI Agents

This MCP server enables AI agents to interact with Webex messaging through natural language prompts. Here are practical examples of how agents can utilize the Webex bot:

3. "Customer Support" room - What to expect and how to help customers
4. Direct message to release manager with detailed deployment log
```

**"Escalation workflows"**
```
If a P1 incident isn't acknowledged within 15 minutes:
1. Send escalation alert to "Critical Incidents" room
2. Page the on-call manager directly
3. Create a conference bridge and share details
4. Notify executive team if incident exceeds 1 hour
5. Update incident status in all relevant rooms
```

These examples demonstrate how AI agents can use natural language to orchestrate complex Webex messaging workflows, making incident response, team coordination, and operational communications more efficient and automated.
